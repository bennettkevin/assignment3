        <p>
            There you have a few restaurants from right around campus. As well as some of the delicious dishes
            they have to offer. I hope to see some of you around possibly grabbing an Espresso Smoothie on your
            way to that evening class, or even a delicious slice of pizza from Slices at lunch time. Have a wonderful
            semester! <a href="#intro">Back to Top</a>
